### Privacy Policy for Toonit

**Effective Date:** 8/6/2025

Thank you for using Toonit ("the App"), provided by Prox Labs. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, and your choices regarding your information.

By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

#### 1. Information We Collect

To provide and improve our service, we collect the following types of information:

**a) Information You Provide Directly**

*   **Photos and Images:** The core function of Toonit requires you to upload your photos or images ("User Images"). We only process the images you choose to upload from your device's gallery.
*   **Permissions:** To function correctly, the App will ask for permission to access your device's photo gallery (storage). This is necessary to allow you to select an image for transformation and to save the final generated image back to your device.

**b) Information We Collect Automatically**

*   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use, the styles you select, and the frequency of your use. This helps us understand what is popular and how to improve the user experience.
*   **Device Information:** We may collect information about your mobile device, including the device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (like the Google Advertising ID), IP address, and mobile network information.
*   **Crash and Performance Data:** If the App crashes, we may collect diagnostic data to help us identify and fix bugs.

#### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide the Core Service:** We use your uploaded User Images to apply the selected AI art style and generate a new image for you.
*   **To Improve and Personalize the App:** We analyze usage data to improve app functionality, design, and performance. We also use local storage on your device to save your list of "Favourite" styles for easier access.
*   **To Provide Advertising:** Toonit is a free, ad-supported application. We use the information we collect to display relevant advertisements to you, which helps us keep the App free.
*   **To Ensure Security and Comply with Legal Obligations:** We use information to prevent fraud, enforce our terms of service, and comply with legal requirements.

#### 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

**a) With Third-Party Service Providers**

We rely on third-party services to provide the core functionality of the App.

*   **AI Image Processing (Replicate):** When you upload a User Image and select a style, we send that image to **Replicate** (provided by Replicate, Inc.) through their API. Replicate's AI models perform the artistic transformation. We do not store your original or generated images on our own servers. Your images are processed by Replicate and are subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to review the [Replicate Privacy Policy](https://replicate.com/privacy).
*   **Advertising (Google AdMob):** We use **Google AdMob** to serve advertisements within the App. Google and its partners may use cookies and device identifiers to collect data and serve personalized ads based on your visits to our App and other sites on the Internet. You can learn more about how Google collects and uses data and how to control the information sent to Google by visiting [Google's Privacy & Terms page](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads). You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ad Settings.

**b) For Legal Reasons**

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
*   Comply with a legal obligation.
*   Protect and defend our rights or property.
*   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the App.
*   Protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

#### 4. Data Retention and Security

*   **User Images:** As stated above, we **do not** store your User Images on our servers. They are sent to Replicate for processing and then a result is sent back to your device.
*   **Locally Stored Data:** Information like your "Favourites" list is stored locally on your device and is removed when you clear the app's data or uninstall the App.
*   **Security:** We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

#### 5. Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

#### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
